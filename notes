--> Difference between NPM and NPX

        ->NPX is a tool included in npm version 5.2 
        and it help to run the library expicitly. 
        NPM is node package managerand provide 
        executable environment

--> monster--rolodex/package.json

        ->JSON is a file that tells our application 
        or tells any developer looking at the 
        application. What are the different 
        libraries or packages that this project 
        needs in order to work?

        ->React Scripts is the kind of package 
        helper that create React app gave us so that 
        it can make our life easier when it comes to 
        doing all the different things we need to to 
        develop a React application. These React 
        scripts are just different tools that help 
        us leverage these new scripts that were 
        generated.
        ->Start will take all the files and run them
        in local development.

-->Entry for project is index.js file.

-->React and ReactDOM libraries are extremely 
important

-->BEBEL: condense code into old style code so that 
it could be understood by all

-->WEBPACK: modulize our code into chunks

-->React 18 Strict Mode (the mode we generally 
always run React in!), for better debugging they've 
started doing a double invocation for certain things 
in a components lifecycle! If you see renders twice, 
this will be why! In React 17 console.log was 
automatically suppressed, but with React 18 they've 
stopped suppressing them.

-->shallow merging it will look for any keys that 
exist in the current state object and it will update 
them to the new one that we have.
